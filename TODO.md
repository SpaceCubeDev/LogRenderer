# TODO list

- Choose how many lines should be displayed
- Make groups of servers, and display only the groups in the navbar. Display the server they contain when clicked,
  display full groups on index page ...
- Make configuration templates that can be used mutiple times for several servers
- Make archive loader trigger button not appear if log archiving is disabled for the current server
- Better error handling ...
- Move the archive loader background & inners outside from the main (Y position too low)
- Add config section for log files with dynamic path (like servers/*/logs/latest.log, which finds the log file of every server in the 'servers' directory)
