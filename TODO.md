# TODO list

- Add css configuration for template injection to add custom fields. Maybe in its own file ?
- Better error handling ...
- Allow cookies from custom website urls
- Change "classic" to "static"
- Add tabs to navbar, for example to pile up all web-related logs in a "Web" tab
- Add a motd on the home page, like rendered Markdown with https://github.com/yuin/goldmark
- Draft up the README
